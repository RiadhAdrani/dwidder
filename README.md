# [Dwidder](https://riadhadrani.github.io/dwidder/)

Dwidder is a twitter clone made to showcase the potential of [Recursive.js](https://github.com/RiadhAdrani/recursive)

The name came originally from a tunisian meal called `Dwida` as I was developping the app.

_The prototype may contains bugs as it was not well tested at the time of writing these lines._
